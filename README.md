## Description

This gem is created as the simplest way to deploy an interview question. The original question was as follows

-------------------------------------------
### Write a program that calculates and prints out a multiplication table of the first 10 calculated prime numbers.

*Detail:* The program must run from the command line and print to screen 1 table.
Across the top and down the left side should be the 10 primes, and the body of the table should contain the product of multiplying these numbers.
 
Please include tests.

Think about cases where the code doesn't know the upper limit (maybe it's 30 and not 10 primes?)
Think about code complexity.
Don't use the Ruby prime method.

Impress me :-)
